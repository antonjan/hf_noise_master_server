<p><strong>This is the RF Noise Monitoring Mater server for AMSATSA Noise Monitoring project</strong></p>

<p>
1) This System consists of remote stations running on a Linux operating ether on Raspberry Pi or Laptop with RTL dongle recording HF noise at the moment<br>
2) The Linux Remote stations will record RF Noise in 1 Mhz bandwidth blocks from 1 Mhz to 30Mhz and will generate local graphs and will also send the data to the master server witch is this server<br>
3) Radio Amateurs that want to be part of this project can get the required equipment and the register their staion on this master station.<br>
4) The reomete station software is avalibe from <a href="http://www.giga.co.za/ocart/index.php?route=product/product&search=hf%20noise&product_id=344">Giga Technology</a><br>
5) The HF SDR Dongles is also avalible from <a href="http://www.giga.co.za/ocart/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=357">Gita technology click here for more information</a><br>
6) What antenna do I need for this system? (This is still under discussion at the next SDR Workshop)<br>
7) More Information regaring the remote station on Raspberry Pi is <a href="http://zr6aic.blogspot.co.za/2017/08/rf-noise-monitoring-system-for-hf.html">avalible here.</a><br>
8) More Information regarding the bootable USB memorystick with persistins is <a href="http://zr6aic.blogspot.co.za/2017/11/hf-noise-monitoring-system-running-from.html">avalibe here.</a><br>
9) The Process to enable your remote station is described in the <a href="https://github.com/antonjan/hf_noise/blob/master/uploads/README.md">readme here</a><br><hr>
<b>How dose the system work</b><br>

<b>How dose the HF Noise Monitoring system work.</b><br>
<br>
The HF noise monitoring system takes a 1Mhz bandwidth samples every 2 minutes using the rtl_power utility and save the measurements in a CVS fie.<br>
The 2 minute scheduling is done with a Crontab calling a script in the hf_noise directory.
The RF Samples is taken at a 1Mhz bandwidth from 1M to 30Mhz therefore 29 of  the CVS files is created and gets appended as the measurements is made.<br>
A Perl script utility is the executed from a cron scedular  to read the 29 CSV files and import there data into a RRD database.<br>
The RRD database then gets interrogated by another Perl script scheduled by a cronjob to generate the graph Images and html files and get saved in the Apache web server graph directory witch is the exposed on http://localhost/hf_noise/graph/1Mhz_Power.php<br>

The RRD database will then create the Hourly, Daily,Weekly,Monthly and Yearly averages and   then generates the graphs every 2 minutes according to the parameters passed to Database.<br>
The generated graphs is then displayed in a php page via a Apache web server with an php plugin on the following url http://localhost/hf_noise/graph/1Mhz_Power.php.<br>
Trends can then be seen on a graphs over time.<br>
The heat map is generated by a python script from different CSV files and is saved in the /var/www/hf_noise/images directory and can be accessed on the local web server on the following url http://localhost/hf_noise/images
